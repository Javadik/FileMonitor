The FileMonitor project is a C# WinForms application that monitors file system changes and manages log file operations. Here's a breakdown of key classes and methods:

**1. Logger Class (Base Class for File Monitoring)**
- **Key Properties:**
  - `FileSystemWatcher watcher`: Monitors file system changes
  - `Timer timer`: Triggers periodic operations
  - `HashSet<string> TotalList`: Tracks files to process
  - `List<string> richList`: Stores log messages
- **Core Methods:**
  - `Start()`: Initializes monitoring
  - `Stop()`: Stops monitoring
  - `Watcher_Created/Changed/Deleted/Renamed()`: Event handlers for file system changes
  - `TimerProc()`: Triggers file copying operations
  - `RecordEntry()`: Logs file events
  - `FileCheck()`: Validates file existence
  - `PathCheck()`: Validates directory paths

**2. LoggerFile Class (Inherits Logger)**
- **Specialized Features:**
  - XML file processing with `ProcessXml()` (uses regex to extract FILE_NAME tags)
  - File copying with path replacement
  - `CurPlayItogAdd()`: Manages XML file updates with timestamped backups
  - `ChangeFileName()`: Modifies filenames with timestamp suffixes
  - `IsFileReady()`: Ensures files are available for processing

**3. LoggerPath Class (Inherits Logger)**
- **Key Functionality:**
  - Path monitoring with `IsFileReady()` for file availability
  - Handles directory tracking and file copying operations

**4. OldFile Class**
- **Main Features:**
  - `DeleteFilesOlderThan()`: Deletes files older than specified TimeSpan
  - `GetMaxAge()`: Converts user input to TimeSpan for age filtering

**5. Form1 Class (Main Application Form)**
- **Key Components:**
  - UI elements: TextBoxes, Buttons, Timers
  - `btStart_Click()`: Initializes monitoring and starts processes
  - `btStop_Click()`: Stops monitoring operations
  - `CheckList()`: Updates UI with log messages
  - `LoadSettings()`: Loads saved paths from Settings.Default
  - `clearOldFiles()`: Triggers file cleanup
  - `FileMonitor_FormClosing()`: Saves settings to Properties.Settings

**Key Operations:**
- File monitoring through FileSystemWatcher with 10-second debounce
- XML file processing with regex pattern matching
- File copying with path replacement logic
- Periodic cleanup of old files (every 10 seconds)
- Settings persistence through Application Settings
- Thread-safe operations with lock(obj) blocks
- File availability checks before processing

The system uses a combination of file system monitoring, XML processing, and periodic cleanup operations to track file changes, manage log files, and handle file copying operations with path replacement capabilities.
